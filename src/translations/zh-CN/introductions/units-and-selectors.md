One of the reasons CSS is so tough to master is that even apparently small decisions can sometimes have big consequences. Should you size your fonts in ems or pixels? Which selector should you use? Is there a way to avoid having to use JavaScript to accomplish what you want?

Having a good grasp of units and selectors makes all these decisions, if not simple, at least a little easier.
