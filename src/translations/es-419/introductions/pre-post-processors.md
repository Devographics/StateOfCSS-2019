Pre-processors like Sass and Less were the vanguard of “CSS 2.0”. At a time where the language itself could seem pretty stagnant, they introduced new features like variables and nesting by introducing a compile step to the mix. 

More than a decade later, CSS itself is catching up but the pre-processors are holding strong, with Sass being a mainstay in any front-end stack (although CSS-in-JS is looking to change that – but more on this later). 

And on the “post-processor” side, PostCSS has managed to carve out a niche of its own by being a complementary tool that makes your CSS workflow even better.
