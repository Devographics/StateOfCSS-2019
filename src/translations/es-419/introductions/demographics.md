This first ever State of CSS survey reached 11,307 people in 135 different countries. This obviously only represents a tiny part of the overall CSS developer community, but for a first edition we think it's pretty encouraging. 

And it's fair to assume our survey audience leans a bit towards early adopters and the more cutting-edge part of the community, since they are the ones most likely to hear about a survey in the first place. But we like to think this also means our data is a good preview of where the mainstream side of the ecosystem will be a few years from now. 

It's also worth mentioning that since a sizeable share of survey respondents learned about it through having previously filled out the [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com) survey, our data may also lean toward the “[back of the front-end](http://bradfrost.com/blog/link/how-to-think-like-a-front-end-developer-with-brad-frost/)”, in other words the more JavaScript-oriented part of the front-end world.

All that being said, we still think there's a lot of very valuable insights in here, and we're very excited to finally be able to share them all with you!
