CSS-in-JS has been one of the biggest developments of the past few years in the CSS world. Just like preprocessors bypassed CSS to introduce their own set of new features over a decade ago, CSS-in-JS libraries piggyback on JavaScript's power to make their own path without waiting for CSS to catch up. 

But while some libraries like Styled Components and Emotion have established themselves as solid options, the overall ecosystem is still very fragmented and in constant movement. So it remains to be seen what place CSS-in-JS will occupy in the overall ecosystem in the long run. 

One thing is sure though: more competition is always good, and if CSS can steal some of its JavaScript cousin's freshest ideas then we'll all be better off for it!
