## Support the survey and look good in the process!

A quick announcement before the survey results. This year we're trying something new to finance our efforts: we're releasing our very own **ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘• State of CSS T-shirt ðŸ‘•ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽˆ**!

What makes this shirt truly special is that it's the only piece of clothing that also **teaches you practical, real-world CSS techniques**.

So whether you're going to a conference, a job interview, or just work, this shirt will demonstrate your CSS mastery like no other garment can!
