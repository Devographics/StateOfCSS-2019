Almost all our respondents have used animations, transitions, and transforms. Which should come at no surprise, as just ten minutes browsing any modern website will show you that the era of static, motionless pages is well and truly over. 

From simple hover effects to more complex typographical or graphical animations, CSS can probably handle whatever you can throw at it!
