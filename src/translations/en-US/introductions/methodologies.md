CSS stands out among programming languages (if it even is one… but that's a whole other debate!) as one of the few that has given birth to methodologies that aim to codify the “right” way to write it. 

While BEM is ahead of the pack here, Atomic CSS is also starting to gain ground with its completely new utility-class-driven philosophy. 

In the end, we might never find the one true way to write CSS, but that's not going to stop us from looking!
