Web development is kinda like a big family. HTML is the no-nonsense, reliable big sister, and JavaScript is the flashy, rebellious teenager going through a new phase every year and telling you you're too old to understand.

In that analogy CSS would be the well-behaved, studious kid who always thinks about everybody else and never makes a rash decision. 

But don't take CSS for granted: despite being over 20 years old, there's signs that CSS might soon experience the same tumultuous teenage years that JavaScript just went through. Flexbox! Grid! CSS-in-JS! CSS is finally dyeing its hair pink and getting a tattoo just like it's always wanted. 

Parenting books won't help with this one, but don't worry. We've surveyed over 10,000 developers to ask them which CSS features they use, which tools they've adopted, and much more.

<span class="first-line"><span class="first-letter">CSS</span> is always changing.</span> New features, new approachs, new pre-/post-prrocessors… It's part of the fun, but it can also feel overwhelming sometimes. 

That's where the State of CSS survey comes in: this year, we surveyed over 20,000 developers to figure out what they're using, what they're happy with, and what they want to learn. And the result is a unique collection of stats and insights that will hopefully help you make your own way through the CSS ecosystem & features. 

If you want to learn more about what's new this year, check out our [announcement post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-state-of-javascript-2018-8322bcc51bd8) for more details.

### Resources

We figure a lot of you are checking out this survey to help you figure out what to learn next. So we've included links to useful CSS resources throughout the survey to help point you in the right direction. 

Full disclosure: some of them are paid sponsorships, but no matter what they're all high-quality resources from people we know and respect who have decided to support our project.
