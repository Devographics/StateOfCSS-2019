<span class="first-letter">I</span>n the web development family, JavaScript has developed a bit of a reputation as the angry, rebellious teenager going through a new phase every year and telling you you're just too old to understand. CSS on the other hand has always been the studious, well-behaved kid who always stays polite and never makes a rash decision. 

But don't take things for granted: despite being over 20 years old, there's signs that CSS might be going through the same tumultuous teenage years that JavaScript just went through. Flexbox! Grid! CSS-in-JS! In 2019, CSS is finally dyeing its hair pink and getting a tattoo just like it's always secretly wanted. 

Parenting books won't help much with this one, but that's where we come in: we've surveyed over 10,000 developers in this first ever State of CSS survey. So join us to find out which CSS features are used the most, which tools are gaining adoption, and much more.

### Team

The State of CSS Survey is created and maintained by:

- [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/sachagreif) (me!): Design, writing, coding
- [Raphaël Benitte](https://twitter.com/benitteraphael): Data analysis, data visualizations

Be sure to check out my React/GraphQL JavaScript framework, [Vulcan.js](http://vulcanjs.org), as well as Raphaël's React data visualization library [nivo](https://nivo.rocks).
